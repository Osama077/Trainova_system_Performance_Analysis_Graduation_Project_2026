# Frontend Setup & Installation Guide

## 📦 Prerequisites

Ensure you have installed:
- **Node.js** v16+ ([Download](https://nodejs.org))
- **npm** v8+ (comes with Node.js)
- **Backend running** on `http://localhost:8000`

Verify installation:
```bash
node --version    # Should be v16+
npm --version     # Should be v8+
```

## 🚀 Installation Steps

### Step 1: Navigate to Frontend Directory
```bash
cd front-end
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

This will install:
- React 18.2.0
- Axios 1.6.0
- Tailwind CSS 3.3.0
- React Router 6.20.0
- React Scripts 5.0.1

**Expected time**: 2-5 minutes

### Step 3: Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set your backend URL:
```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1
REACT_APP_ENV=development
```

### Step 4: Start Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

Output should show:
```
Compiled successfully!

You can now view match-performance-frontend in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000
  On Your Network:  http://YOUR_IP:3000

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use npm run build.
```

### Step 5: Open in Browser

Click the link or open: `http://localhost:3000`

## 🔧 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: `npm install` fails

**Solution**:
```bash
# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# Try again
npm install
```

### Issue: Port 3000 already in use

**Solution**:
```bash
# Linux/Mac
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

# Windows PowerShell
Stop-Process -Id (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 3000).OwningProcess -Force
```

### Issue: "Cannot GET /api/v1/" in browser

**Solution**:
- Backend not running!
- Start backend: `python run_pipeline.py --mode api`
- Verify on `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### Issue: Player dashboard shows empty charts

**Solutions**:
1. Check player name spelling (case-sensitive)
2. Verify backend has processed data
3. Run: `python run_pipeline.py --mode pipeline`
4. Try a known player: "Messi"

### Issue: CORS errors in console

**Solution**:
- Backend CORS must allow localhost:3000
- Check backend `main.py` for CORS config
- Should already be configured

## 📊 Testing All Endpoints

Use the built-in **API Testing Dashboard**:

1. Navigate to **🧪 API Test**
2. Configure player name (default: "Messi")
3. Click **🚀 Test All Endpoints**
4. View results:
   - ✅ Green = Success
   - ❌ Red = Failed
   - Shows response times

### Expected Results

All 9 endpoints should succeed:
1. ✅ Health Check
2. ✅ Get Player List
3. ✅ Get Player Dashboard
4. ✅ Get Player Score
5. ✅ Get Player Stats
6. ✅ Compare Players
7. ✅ Get Team Summary
8. ✅ Get Match Report
9. ✅ Get Benchmark

## 🛠️ Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server (http://localhost:3000)
npm start

# Build for production (into build/ folder)
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Clean build cache
npm cache clean --force

# Install specific version
npm install package-name@version
```

## 🌐 Backend Communication

Frontend communicates with FastAPI backend:

**Base URL**: `http://localhost:8000/api/v1`

**All requests go through**: `src/api.js`

Check `src/api.js` for all endpoint definitions:
```javascript
// Example: Player endpoints
PlayerAPI.getPlayerList()
PlayerAPI.getPlayerDashboard(playerName)
PlayerAPI.comparePlayer([id1, id2, id3])
```

## 📚 File-by-File Explanation

### `src/api.js` - API Client
Defines all HTTP calls to backend:
- `PlayerAPI` - All player endpoints
- `TeamAPI` - All team endpoints
- `MatchAPI` - All match endpoints
- `BenchmarkAPI` - Benchmark endpoints
- `AnalysisAPI` - Analysis endpoints

### `src/App.js` - Main Component
Routes between different pages

### `src/components/`
- `Navigation.js` - Top bar + server status
- `HomePage.js` - Landing page
- `PlayerList.js` - Browse players
- `PlayerDashboard.js` - 9-chart view
- `PlayerComparison.js` - Compare UI
- `APITester.js` - Endpoint testing
- `LoadingSpinner.js` - Loading indicator
- `ErrorAlert.js` - Error notification

## ✨ Features After Setup

✅ Browse all players
✅ Search players by name
✅ View 9-chart dashboard per player
✅ Compare up to 5 players
✅ Test all API endpoints
✅ View response times
✅ Real-time server status

## 🚀 Deployment (Optional)

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized build in `build/` folder.

### Deploy to Server
```bash
# Copy build folder to web server
cp -r build/* /var/www/html/
```

## 🆘 Need Help?

1. Check browser console (F12 → Console tab)
2. Run "🧪 API Test" to verify connectivity
3. Check that backend is running: `http://localhost:8000`
4. Verify `.env` file has correct API URL
5. Try clearing npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
